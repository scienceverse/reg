# Issues

* translations for select items and checkbox options


## Sidebar


## Study Info



## Authors

* Add custom info to editing author even if Author Update button not clicked ???
* Upload Authors from csv or YAML
* custom info list into table (?)
* change add button to update when editing

## Hypotheses

* add evaluation descriptions back??
* custom info (?)

## Data

* Custom info for data
* Allow adding dataset without data (or turn off button)
* Download data button to top?
* include data checkbox doesn't do anything
* update sim section when editing data with a design

### Simulate Data

* fix sim data on server (crashes) !!!!!!!!
* reorder summary/plot tab, entry and buttons (?)
* bold lines under each b_cell group (?)
* add instructions tab (?)
* Don't allow Add factor with duplicate level names
* Don't allow Add factor with duplicate factor name (require select from factor_chooser)

* glitch when:
    * save factor with 3 levels and custom names, 
    * start new factor with 2 levels, 
    * change default name for new factor,
    * then change to 3 level


### Codebook

* add codebook from scratch
* edit uploaded data column names (??)
* edit factor levels/desc in codebook

## Analyses

* Run analysis analysis-specific?
* return tab: better example
* if no code, don't prepend blank line to return code
* custom info for analysis

## Summaries

* human-readable in tabset?
* better data summary
* check pre and postreg download (not working on server)
